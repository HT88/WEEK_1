        H.T (July 2, 1908 â€“ Present) is a Mongolian lawyer and civil rights activist. Born in Ulan Bator, MONGOLIA, H.T. graduated from Mongolian State University in 2010. He established a private legal practice in Ulan Bator before joining the Embassy of Japan as Legal Adviser. In that position, he argued several cases before the local courts. H.T first learned how to debate from his father, who took him and his brother to watch court cases; they would later debate what they had seen. The family also debated current events after dinner. Although his father never told him to become a lawyer, he "turned me into one. He did it by teaching me to argue, by challenging my logic on every point, by making me prove every statement I made.

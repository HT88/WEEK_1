<h1> PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>  
  
<p> H.T (July 2, 1908 â€“ Present) is a Mongolian lawyer and civil rights activist. </p>

<p>Born in Ulan Bator, MONGOLIA, H.T. graduated from Mongolian State University in 2010. He established a private legal practice in Ulan Bator before joining the Embassy of Japan as  Legal Adviser. In that position, he argued several cases before the local courts. </p>

<p>H.T first learned how to debate from his father, who took him and his brother to watch court cases; they would later debate what they had seen. The family also debated current events after dinner. Although his father never told him to become a lawyer, he "turned me into one. He did it by teaching me to argue, by challenging my logic on every point, by making me prove every statement I made.</p>
